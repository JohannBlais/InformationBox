Status for .NET 4.0+ branch: 
![master](https://johannblais.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/ce081581-71ef-4bf2-bda5-0288ef071e07/1/badge)

**Project Description**

InformationBox is a flexible alternative to the default MessageBox included in the System.Windows.Forms namespace.

It provides the same base functionality and is extended with, for example, custom buttons, or personnalized icons. You can customize your InformationBoxes with custom screen position, or custom button placement. And there are many more features !

InformationBox is the simplest and easiest way to create personalized MessageBox.

Stop wasting time developing your own custom MessageBox, everything you need is already available. Just customize your MessageBox using the visual designer and the code is automatically generated !

**Highlights**

The InformationBox initializes itself according the provided parameters. The constructor accepts an undefined number of parameters, in an undefined order. Unlike the default MessageBox, if you only need to specify the default button, you do not have to provide any other parameter. Provide what you need, and let the default values do their jobs.
A version exists for both the framework 1.1 and 2.0+ and 4.0+.
The .NET 4.0 version supports optional parameters allowing clearer use of the different parameters.

Starting with release 0.6.0.0, a new visual style is available. It is only for the .NET 2.0+ version. As a result, the latest .NET 1.1 version is 0.5.1.0.
It is not planned to implement the new visual style in the .NET 1.1 branch, and as soon as this branch is stable, it will be discontinued, allowing faster development of the .NET 2.0+ branch.

The project is available on NuGet, or compilable from source.
